# Fellowship-Challenge
#This project uses the US Dept. of Transportation on-time arrival data for non-stop domestic flights by major air carriers to predict arrival delays.
#ID3 based decision tree machine learning algorithms is used to predict on-time arrival of flights.
# "delaytraining.csv" file is used to train the model
# "delaytest.csv" file is used to test the model
#run "IDthree.ipynb" file to train the algorithm. The out put is written on the file "tree.txt" and displayed at run time in a dictionary format
#Then run "main.ipynb" to predict on-time arrivals. The out put is written in a table format on the file "result.txt" and display at run time in list format
